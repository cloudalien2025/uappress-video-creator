### What you get every time (no options, always-on)
- `chapter_XX..._final_subs.mp4`  ✅ (subtitles embedded)
- `chapter_XX....srt` ✅
- `uappress_documentary_full.srt` ✅
- `uappress_documentary_final_subs.mp4` ✅ (when not in 1-chapter test mode)
- `uappress_video_outputs.zip` ✅

If you upload one of your real Documentary TTS Studio ZIPs and tell me how the files are named (or paste a screenshot of the ZIP contents), I can tweak the pairing logic so it matches perfectly even when filenames aren’t numbered.
